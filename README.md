# Virtual-Assistant
A simple virtual assistant created using python and in built python libraries, which takes speech input and performs certain tasks as output.

Back when I was in 12th grade. I had an additional subject, computer science, where Python was included in the curriculum. So, for the CBSE project, I made a virtual assistant using Python modules such as:
1. pyttsx3
2. speech_recognition
3. datetime
4. wikipedia
5. webbrowser
6. os

I made this project with the help of a YouTuber named CodeWithHarry (link attached in the project report).
It was really fun building this project; I learned a lot of things about different libraries, oops, and many more.
I have attached a Word document, including the project report and source code. Do check it out.
